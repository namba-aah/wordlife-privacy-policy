# namba-aah

A creative automation workflow built with n8n to publish poetic content to Pinterest using secure OAuth2 integration.
## Privacy & Data Use

This application integrates with the Pinterest API to help users publish and manage their own content.

- **Data Access**: The app only requests the minimum scopes required (e.g., `pins:write`, `boards:read`) to allow publishing pins and organizing boards.  
- **Authentication**: All access is handled securely through Pinterest’s OAuth2 flow. Users must explicitly grant permission before any data is accessed.  
- **Data Storage**: No personal data is stored, shared, or sold outside of Pinterest’s secure systems. Tokens are used only to authenticate API requests during active sessions.  
- **Transparency**: This app does not scrape, mass‑automate, or collect user information beyond what is necessary for publishing pins.  
- **Contact**: For questions or concerns, please reach out at [jadamloa@outlook.com].  

By using this integration, you agree that your Pinterest data is handled securely and only for the stated purpose of publishing and managing your own pins.
